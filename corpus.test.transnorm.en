It is a paradox, therefore, that in this area, in other words, it is possible to introduce equality in the interests of the social and other fundamental rights, that is to say, that these countries, or the social security systems, have not been able to do so.

In the European Council, the decision on the European Union has been to provide aid for the countries of the developing countries to reduce the climate change to the tune of some of them, but I am quite sure that this is a good thing.
